# Portfolio_SFelbeck

For this homework assignment I was tasked with making a professional portfolio site with page navigation links and hover effects over certain buttons.
The process of creating this site was largely smooth with not many persistant issues, though there was a couple hover effects and elements I wanted, that I was not quite able to implement this go around without large scale changes to the core framework.
I plan to either upgrade this site or reuse some of the code in the future as my professional portfolio.

Here are some pictures of the finished site!
